## Dependencies:
* Dependencies are managed by pod
* Pods are ignored by git, so you need to install them first

## Architecture:
* VIP (clean architecture) as project name is clear :)

## Event handling:
* Implemented a custom event handler you can find [here](./CleanSwiftSample/Managers/NotificationManager.swift)

## Languages:
* You can easily add/download language files to support more languages without updating app since all texts are handled by [a language manager](./CleanSwiftSample/Managers/LanguageManager.swift)

## To do:
* Tests
* Improve error handling
* Themeable
